{"name":"Paper Read Summary in Week 7","tagline":"","body":"# Geometry of Power Flows and Optimization in Distribution Networks \r\n\r\n***\r\nThis paper mainly focuses on the investigation of the geometry of the feasible injection regions in power flow networks. Many interesting observations have been shown in this work. \r\n\r\nStarting from the two-bus power injection case, when there is only angle constraint, the set of Pareto-optimal points of the injection region remains unchanged by taking the convex hull. The initial problem is not convex due to the angle constraint, using this property, we can get the same optimal solution by solving a convex problem. This sounds to be very nice. \r\n\r\nWhen the voltage is fixed, the injection of the tree network can be written as a linear transformation of the product of two-bus injection regions. Hence, the feasible region can be simplified a lot. \r\n\r\nActually, I am most interested in these two parts of this paper. It provides me some meaningful insights. For solving optimization problem, we guys should never feel helpless. We can always find a nice result if we can come up with new ideas and try and error. Of course, the strong mathematical background is necessary. \r\n \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
